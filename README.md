### Description

This mini tutorial explains how you can create a Java class and the invoking it from a VB project, this java class gets some data from an Access file and will show it in the VB project. Of course you need the Microsoft SDK for Java 4.0, microsoft removed it from its site so I found it in another web site, I included the link within my mini tutorial.
